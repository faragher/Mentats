# Mentats
Mentats mod for RimWorld

Adding mentats from the Dune universe. Initial release.

The Mentat Training perk increases learn speed to 150% and eliminates skill loss over time.

Also adds a cultivatable plant to create the Juice of Sapho.

With Royalty released, the lack of Dune-based mods was even more noticable. This mod is my first RimWorld mod and of limited scope to get the workflow of not only making a mod, but also the experience of post-release support.

Should be compatible with everything unless there's a namespace collision. If there's anyone with better lore information, let me know. If this goes smoothly, a larger Dune-themed mod may follow.

Known issues:
Images need work
Plant still uses potato plant graphic.
No real game balancing has been attempted.
